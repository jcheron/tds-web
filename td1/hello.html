	<p><span>Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy 
	text of the printing and typesetting <span>industry</span>. 
	Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
	since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
	type and scrambled <span class="rose">it to make a type specimen</span> book.
	It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
	into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
	It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
	containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
	publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
	<span>Lorem Ipsum</span>.</p>
